[Check when is your bus](https://when-is-my-bus.netlify.app)

Tired of sifting through old pictures of timetables that you captured ages ago?

Open **When is my bus?** Simply input your duty time, departing point, and within seconds, you'll receive the optimal bus schedule to get to work on time.

## What it does

<!-- **When is my bus** takes user's duty starting time and
departing point, and provide the best bus timing to take.
The commuting time is set differently for each bus stop. When searched, it provides 3 timings which include the best option and 2 previous bus timings for special occasions like heavy traffic.

Also if a user is traveling from work to home, it automaticall takes the current time and offers next 3 buses available to take. -->

## Why was this built?

<!-- I use the company provided bus that stops twice to take employees to work. Every once in a while, the company updates the bus schedule and upload it on its website.
Due to the nature of my job, duty time is always different, hence I have to check the timetable to choose which bus to take. And as we all do, such pictures are saved long time ago and it was tedius to search through my phone gallery.

So I came up the idea design a app that checks the best bus to take for me. Automate boring things, that was the reason. -->
